mcSlider Readme
===============

This is a very rough-round-the-edges slider manager plugin for Wordpress.
It uses the amazing [Slides](http://slidesjs.com/) slideshow plugin for jQuery. 

Check out the to-do list for possible features that it may have.

To Do
-----

* <del>hi-jack wordpress' upload window to allow user to add images</del>
* make sure we always get the max size from the upload window when user clicks 'insert image'
* <del>rely on user to provide slider size images but use timthumb.php to resize images that are too big</del>
* allow a nice way for images to be resized maybe through [jcrop](http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html) plugin
* <del>allow user to choose whether they have captions or not and to enter caption for individual sliders</del>
* <del>allow links on a per slide basis</del>
